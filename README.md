# Chunk to Modifier

'Chunk to Modifier' is a small program to easily convert regular Ninja Chunk strip models to the Ninja Chunk volume format in the form of an .nja file printed to stdout.

Chunk volumes were heavily used in Sonic Adventure 2 for the stencil shadows, but due to their lack of use in later ports and titles no tools exist to easily create them. 'Chunk to Modifier' allows you to use the existing tools to make regular Chunk Objects and then quickly convert them.

Simply drag and drop an .sa2mdl file on the .exe and a converted model will be printed to the console in the .nja text format for importing into your projects.
