# Chunk to Modifier

A small, non-flashy tool to easily convert regular Ninja Chunk strips to the Ninja Chunk volume format in the form of an .nja file printed to stdout. No modern tools exist to create Ninja Chunk modifier volumes, so this allows you to use the existing community tools to make regular Chunk models and then convert them.

Simply drag and drop an .sa2mdl file on the .exe and a converted model will be printed to the console in the .nja text format for importing into your projects.
